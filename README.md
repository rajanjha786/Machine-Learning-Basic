# Machine Learning

This Project aims to make understand the basics of Machine learning with the proper balance of theory and hands on with **python** as programming language

## Installations

If you already have python installed with required package listed in `requirements.txt` you can directly jump to 
[Starting Jupyter](#starting-jupyter).</br>
You need to have a Python installed in your system to proceed with this project just check whether python is installed.
```
$ python --version
```
If you get the version number means python is installed or else you can install the python, on windows and MacOS you can just download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).</br>

**python 2.7.12** is preferred for this project

On linux 

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3
```

We require various python packages to follow this tutorial all the required packages are mentioned in requirement.txt file.</br>
you can download the packages using the below command

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting Jupyter

You can start Jupyter, simply type:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```
This should open up your browser, and you should see Jupyter's tree view, with the contents of the current directory. If your browser does not open automatically, visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/tree). Click on `index.ipynb` to get started!

Congrats! You are ready to learn Machine Learning
